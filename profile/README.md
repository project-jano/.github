## Hi there 👋

### This is Project Jano GitHub repositories


🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

Jano is a set of microservices and libraries that manages End to End Encryption in Mobile Apps. 
It currently implementes a microservice in Golang (backed with a MongoDB) for storing user's certificates and perfoming some operations like sending encrypted push notifications.


🍿 Fun facts

Jano is the God of beginnings, gates, keys, and endings. So it feels natural that Project Jano is an End to End Encryption Platform, and it's focused on Developers.
(Also, Jano is the name of one of my nephews)
